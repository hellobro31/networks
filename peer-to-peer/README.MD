	The enhancements made to your Rust peer-to-peer application focused on improving the logging mechanisms to provide more clarity, context, and detail across various operations within the application. These modifications were intended to aid in debugging, monitoring, and gaining a better understanding of the application's behavior and user interactions. Enhanced Command Processing Logging:
Introduced informative logging at the start of command processing to indicate which command the application is attempting to execute.
Maintained error logging for unrecognized commands but added the specific command text for clearer identification of user input errors.
Detailed Recipe Creation Logging:
Expanded the logging upon successful recipe creation to include the unique ID assigned to the new recipe and its name. This enhancement provides immediate feedback about the outcome of the recipe creation process and aids in tracking specific recipes within the application logs.
Improved Recipe Publishing Logging:
Added success and error logs in the handle_publish_recipe function to delineate clear outcomes of the recipe publishing attempts. Successful publications are now logged with the recipe ID, while failures log the error details alongside the ID, enhancing the traceability of these operations.
Network Event Logging:
Augmented the logging within the NetworkBehaviourEventProcess<MdnsEvent> implementations to capture events of peer discovery and expiration. New logs indicate when peers are discovered or expired, adding a temporal dimension to understand the network's dynamics and peer availability within the P2P network.
Response and Request Handling Logging:
Implemented additional logging within the response handling routines to confirm and detail the actions taken, particularly when responding to public recipe requests. This includes logging the intent to respond with public recipes and the recipient of these responses, enhancing transparency in data exchange processes within the network.
These enhancements were strategically implemented across the application to improve operational visibility, which is crucial for any peer-to-peer networking application where activities are distributed and decentralized. These improvements aim to facilitate effective monitoring, faster troubleshooting, and better understanding of user interactions and network behaviors within the application.
